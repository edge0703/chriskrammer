<p class="prjinfo">The second challenge of the book &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Workshop-Challenges-Sharpen-Design/dp/1600617972/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358802641&sr=8-1&keywords=Creative+workshop%3A+80+challenges+to+sharpen+your+design+skills">Creative workshop: 80 challenges to sharpen your design skills</a>&rdquo; was to &ldquo;design a typeface composed from elements in the world around you&rdquo;. After a little bit of brainstorming I hit on the idea to pour millet honey pops onto a brown sheet of paper and form letters with them. After a few hours of work my millet-alphabet was ready. An additional goal of the challenge was to design a poster with the lettering, which you can see above.</p>
